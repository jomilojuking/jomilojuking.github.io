During the first week I accomplished learning the basics of Scikit learn, Numpy and Pandas was formally
intorduced to csv and json files and as well the project I would be focusing on;
Sports Brief AI solutions : Developing Post-Game content using box scores and video news reports. 
Furthermore, I learned about git, github and how to create a website on github. 

This week no problems were encountered as each step of the way the faculty members, graduate 
assistantsand teaching assistaants took their time to explain what was taught .Slides were also 
uploaded to catch up on things that could have been missed during explanations.
