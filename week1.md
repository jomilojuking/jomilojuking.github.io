During the first week of my Sports Brief AI project, I achieved several milestones.
I successfully learned the fundamentals of Scikit-learn, Numpy, and Pandas, gaining 
proficiency in handling data analysis and manipulation tasks. Additionally, I was
formally introduced to working with CSV and JSON files, essential for extracting and
managing data, especially from box scores and video news reportsâ€”a key focus area for
my project, Sports Brief AI Solutions: Developing Post-Game Content.

In addition to technical skills, I also learned about version control using Git and GitHub, 
enabling me to efficiently manage project iterations and collaborate with team members.
Furthermore, I gained insights into creating and hosting websites using GitHub, laying the 
foundation for future project showcases and dissemination of findings.

Throughout this week, I encountered no significant issues. Faculty members, graduate 
assistants, and teaching assistants were incredibly supportive, taking the time to explain
concepts thoroughly. They provided comprehensive slides and resources, ensuring that all
participants could catch up on any missed information or clarify doubts promptly.

The supportive learning environment facilitated a smooth transition into the project,
setting a strong foundation for subsequent weeks of exploration and development in sports analytics.
