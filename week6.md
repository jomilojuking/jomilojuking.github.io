In Week 6 of my Sports Brief AI project, I focused on two main tasks. First,
I looked into different machine learning algorithms that could be useful for analyzing 
sports data. I explored methods like regression, classification, and clustering to see
how they could help in sports analytics.

Secondly, I started experimenting with these machine learning models using Morgan State's
datasets. My aim was to find patterns, trends, and connections in the data that could make 
our sports news reporting more insightful. By applying these algorithms, I hoped to find useful
information to make our AI-generated summaries better.

I was also getting ready for a big presentation to show off our progress. Unfortunately, the 
presentation got pushed back, which gave my group and I more time to fine-tune our work and 
add more insights.
