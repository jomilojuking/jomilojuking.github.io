In Week 10 of my Sports Brief AI project, we focused on wrapping up all remaining tasks and finalizing our work. 
We successfully gave our final presentations, showcasing the software prototypes and research findings. We also 
completed our final paper, detailing the project's development and outcomes, and submitted all final blog entries.

During this week, we had an insightful discussion about the future of our project with my mentor, Professor Robison.
This conversation helped outline potential directions and improvements for our work. Additionally, we collected our 
certificates of completion, marking the official end of our project.

Week 10 was pivotal for concluding our Sports Brief AI project. We completed the presentation, finalized the paper,
and discussed future plans with our mentor. These steps provided a comprehensive finish to our project and set the 
stage for its future development.
