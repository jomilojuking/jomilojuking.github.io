During my third week on the Sports Brief AI project, I dedicated my efforts to 
cleaning and organizing the data from the Morgan State Basketball dataset. Using
tools like Sublime Text and Excel, I ensured the data was formatted correctly and 
converted into CSV files. This process involved checking for errors, handling missing 
information, and structuring the data in a way that would facilitate its analysis.

Simultaneously, I began the task of integrating this cleaned dataset into our AI framework.
Specifically, I focused on incorporating transformers, which are advanced tools in machine 
learning known for their ability to process and interpret complex data patterns. Learning 
how to effectively implement transformers was challenging but rewarding, because it allowed us 
to begin using their capabilities for analyzing the basketball team's performance metrics.

Despite encountering challenges, such as accurately translating the dataset into CSV format 
and mastering transformer usage, I made great progress. Collaborating closely with my team
and seeking guidance from my mentor helped in making steady progress.

The groundwork laid during this week is important because it lays the foundation for using both
GANs and transformers within our AI system. These tools will play a crucial role in enhancing 
our ability to analyze and generate meaningful insights from sports data, which would 
lead to great quality and depth of post-game content produced by our Sports Brief AI solution.

Looking forward, I'm excited to improve how we put data together and try out more AI features
that will help us create new and smart sports analyses.
