During my third week, I focused on cleaning up the Morgan State Basketball data and converting it into CSV files using Sublime Text and Excel. I also started integrating Morgan’s datasets into the AI module, specifically using transformers.

One challenge I encountered was the tricky process of converting the datasets into CSV files accurately. Another challenge was learning how to use transformers, which was difficult due to their complexity. Despite these challenges, I made good progress in preparing the data and starting the integration process. This work will help us successfully use both GANs and transformers in our project.
