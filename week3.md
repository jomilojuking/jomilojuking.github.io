During my third week, I focused on cleaning up the Morgan State Basketball
data and converting it into CSV files using Sublime Text and Excel. I also 
started integrating Morganâ€™s datasets into the AI module, specifically using
transformers.

One challenge I encountered was the tricky process of converting the datasets 
into CSV files accurately. Another challenge was learning how to use transformers, 
I was still able to make  good progressin preparing the data and starting the integration 
process. This work will help us successfully use both GANs and transformers in our project.
