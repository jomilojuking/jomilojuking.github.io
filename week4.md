During the fourth week, I made good progress with my Sports Brief AI project. 
This week, I started by organizing college basketball player stats into a clear 
format called a DataFrame. This helped me handle the data easily. Then, I combined 
stats from different teams into one place so I could analyze them together.
An achievement was using a transformer based tool called T5 to summarize stats.
It made short summaries for each team and player based on their combined stats. 

I came across a few challenges this week as well such as keeping different versions
of data and handling missing data but I was able to work with my mentor and team members 
to solve the issues.
