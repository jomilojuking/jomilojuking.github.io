During the fourth week of my Sports Brief AI project, I made good progress. 
First, I organized college basketball player stats into a clear format called 
a DataFrame. This made it easier to work with the data. Then, I combined stats
from different teams so I could look at them together.

I used a text model called T5 to make short summaries for each team and player based 
on their combined stats. It helped summarize the data quickly.

I did face some challenges, like managing different versions of data and dealing 
with missing data. But with help from my mentor and team, I found ways to handle these issues.

Next, I plan to improve my project by exploring predictive analytics and digging deeper 
into how different stats relate to each other. This should give better insights into how 
basketball teams and players perform.
