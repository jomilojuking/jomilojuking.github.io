During the fourth week, I made good progress with my Sports Brief AI project. I started by organizing
college basketball player stats into a clear format called a DataFrame. This helped me handle the data
easily. Then, I combined stats from different teams into one place so I could analyze them together.

A major achivement accomplished in this project this week was using T5,a transformer based model to
summarize stats.It made short summaries for each team and player based on their combined stats. This made 
it easier to understand who was performing well.

A few challenges I faced this week was keeping different versions of data consistent and handling missing data but
with the help of my mentor and team members, I was able it get sort out those issues.
Overall, it was a smooth week and looking forward to diving in to the the literature aspect next week
