## About My Mentor

My mentor, Professor Edward G. Robinson, is a skilled writer, editor, and entrepreneur with
a lot of experience in sports journalism. During our meeting he explained how we are going to use
Morgan State University's football team stats to create AI-driven post-game content. His expertise 
ensures we focus on important data and use AI to write summaries and make video highlights that 
are interesting and engaging. He also provides advice on how to personalize content for different audiences.
