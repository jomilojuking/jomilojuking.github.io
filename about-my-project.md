## About My Project
During my AI Research Internship, I developed a project focused on creating automated 
post-game content. The project utilized Python and transformers to generate accurate box scores
and engaging video news reports from real-time game data. By fine-tuning models, we enhanced 
the narrative depth of AI-generated reports, resulting in increased audience engagement. 
The project streamlined the content generation process, reducing the time required for report 
creation. This involved advanced NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms for both regression
and classification. Overall, the project demonstrated significant improvements in both accuracy
and efficiency of sports news reporting
