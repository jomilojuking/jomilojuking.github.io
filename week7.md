In Week 7 of my Sports Brief AI project, we made significant strides in several areas. We focused on
improving the quality of our generative summaries by using enthusiastic and engaging language, similar
to what you hear from sports commentators. At the same time, we fine-tuned our text model by adjusting 
settings and adding more data, aiming to make it better at summarizing sports information accurately.

We also spent time writing and polishing sections of our research paper. This involved carefully explaining 
our project's goals and why they're important in sports analytics. To show our progress, we created examples 
that demonstrate how our AI can create detailed summaries of player performances. Working with other project 
teams helped us learn new approaches and refine our strategies.

We faced technical challenges too. One was making sure our AI-generated sports news sounded natural and
kept people interested (we call this text-to-speech). We also kept improving our GPT-2 text model based 
on how well it summarized real game data, aiming to make it even better at handling complex sports stats.
