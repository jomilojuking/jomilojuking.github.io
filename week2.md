During my second week on the Sports Brief AI project, I focused on conducting 
research and gathering relevant sources to develop a comprehensive literature review.
This involved delving into topics such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), 
sports news generation, and the integration of artificial intelligence and machine 
learning in similar projects. This exploration provided valuable insights into how 
these technologies can be leveraged to enhance post-game content creation.

One significant achievement was finalizing the selection of our dataset. My group and 
I decided to use the Morgan States basketball team's dataset, ensuring that we had a 
robust foundation of real-world data to work with.

However, a challenge I encountered this week was deciding between using a GAN or transformer
model for our AI solution. After thorough discussion and evaluation, we opted to incorporate
both models into our project strategy. This decision ensures flexibility and resilience, allowing 
us to leverage the strengths of each model and mitigate potential setbacks.

Throughout the week, I benefited from collaborative discussions with my group members and guidance
from mentors. These interactions enabled us to make informed decisions and align our project goals 
effectively. Moving forward, I am confident that this approach will enhance the depth and versatility 
of our Sports Brief AI solution, preparing us for the challenges and opportunities ahead in sports analytics
and AI-driven content generation.
