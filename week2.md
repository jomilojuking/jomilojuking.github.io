During my second week, I worked on finding sources on topics related
to the project and created a literature review.Doing this I was able to 
find information on Generative Adversial Network (GAN),sports news, Artificial 
intelligence, machine lerning and how they work together to make similar
projects. Also, my group and I concluded on the data set we are using which
is Morgan states basketballteam's data set. 

One of the problems I encountered this week was figuring out what type
of AI model to use (either GAN or transformers). My group and I decided 
to use both of them so if anything comes up with the other we would not 
be drawn back.
