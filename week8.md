In Week 8 of my Sports Brief AI project, we made a lot of progress. One big focus was 
developing software prototypes for both text and voice generation using Generative AI
techniques. We built text generation models with frameworks like TensorFlow, which 
helped us create better and more engaging text summaries.

At the same time, we worked on voice generation tools to make dynamic sports news 
reports. Our goal was to make these reports sound exciting, like live sports commentary. 
We tried out different voice synthesis technologies and fine-tuned them to get a natural
and emotional feel.

This week, we also started wrapping up our project. We reviewed all the work we had done 
so far, making sure everything was running smoothly and accurately. We began preparing for
our final presentations and reports, which involved documenting our methods, results, and
the challenges we faced and overcame.

Improving the quality of our generative summaries was a key focus. We kept fine-tuning
our models based on feedback and performance, adding new data to make them more accurate,
and ensuring our voice output was clear and engaging.

In summary, Week 8 was a crucial time for our Sports Brief AI project. We made significant
strides in both text and voice generation, ensuring our outputs were accurate and captivating.
As we moved towards the final stages, we focused on consolidating our work, preparing for presentations,
and continuing to learn from our experiences. This weekâ€™s accomplishments have set a solid foundation for 
the successful completion of our project.
