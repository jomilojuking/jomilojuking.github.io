In Week 5 of my Sports Brief AI project, I focused on diving deep into college basketball stats. 
I crunched numbers like minutes played, field goals, three-pointers, free throws, points scored,
rebounds, assists, personal fouls, turnovers, blocks, and steals. Making sure the data was accurate 
meant handling missing info carefully.

For the generative summaries, I played around with different writing styles to keep things interesting.
Each player got a detailed rundown of how they did, highlighting what they brought to their teams.
I also tested out GPT-2 to see how well it could summarize player stats, tweaking it based on
feedback and real game performances.

A big challenge was mastering all the right sports terms to describe players and teams 
accurately. It's a learning curve to get those terms just right and make sure they make sense 
in our summaries. And we're always modifying GPT-2 to make sure it spits out summaries that are
spot-on and easy to understand.

Throughout Week 5, working closely with my mentors and teammates was crucial to tackling these
challenges and hitting our goals. Together, we also put together a solid abstract outlining what 
we aim to achieve with our project in sports analytics.
